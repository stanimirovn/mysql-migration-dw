This topic explains how to enable service-gateway access.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Service-gateway access enables external clients to connect to a MySQL service.
The clients are typically apps running external to the foundation, apps on a different foundation,
and management tools such as MySQL Workbench.

For a more detailed overview, see [About Service-Gateway Access](./service-gateway-access.html).

To enable service-gateway access for an on-demand offering:

1. [Enable TCP routing using the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile](#tcp-routing)
1. [Configure the firewall to allow incoming traffic to the TCP router](#configure-firewall)
1. [Configure the load balancer in the IaaS to redirect traffic to the TCP router](#configure-lb)
1. [Create a DNS record that maps to the load balancer](#create-dns-record)
1. [Enable service-gateway access](#configure-service-gateway-plan)

<p class="note warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong> VMware recommends that you configure Transport Layer Security (TLS)
  alongside service-gateway access to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
  For instructions on how to configure TLS, see
  <a href="./install-config.html#security">Configure Security</a>.
</p>


## <a id='tcp-routing'></a> Enable TCP Routing Using the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Tile

TCP routing is disabled by default. To enable TCP routing:

1. Go to the Networking pane of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile.
1. Under **Enable TCP requests to apps through specific ports on the TCP router**, select
**Enable TCP routing**.
1. For TCP routing ports, enter one or more ports to which the load balancer forwards requests.
For example, `1024` for a single port or `1024–1123` for a range of ports.
1. Go back to **<%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard &gt; Review Pending Changes**.
1. Click **Apply Changes** for the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile to create the
TCP router.
1. From the status tab of the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> tile, record the cloud identity (CID) of
the TCP router.

    ![Screenshot showing Ops Manager UI with the 'Status' tab selected.
    In the tab contents, there is a table with several columns labeled 'Job', 'Index,' 'IPS', 'AZ',
    and 'CID'. The screenshot highlights with a red outline the last row in the table for the job
    'TCP Router'.](/images/TCP-router-CID.png)

## <a id='configure-firewall'></a> Configure the Firewall to Allow Incoming Traffic to the TCP Router

The steps you take to allow traffic to the TCP router depend on your IaaS:

1. Allow incoming traffic to the TCP router VM created in
[Enable TCP Routing Using the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Tile](#tcp-routing) above.

    For information about how to do so, see the documentation for your IaaS.

## <a id='configure-lb'></a> Configure the Load Balancer in the IaaS to Redirect Traffic to the TCP Router

To configure the load balancer:

1. Use the IaaS console and the CID that you recorded earlier to find the VM that runs the TCP router.
1. Create an external TCP load balancer that points to the VM running the TCP router.
1. Configure a distinct external port range that does not overlap with any of the following:
    + The TCP networking port or port range that you configured in
      [Enable TCP Routing Using the <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> Tile](#tcp-routing) above.
    + The port range configured for service-gateway access for other service tiles,
      such as VMware Tanzu™ RabbitMQ® for VMs.

    For example, if your TCP routing port range is `1024–1123`,
    and ports `1124–1223` are reserved for Tanzu RabbitMQ service instances,
    then your load balancer port range for service gateway must not overlap `1024-1223`.
    <p class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> Each <%= vars.product_short %> service instance using service-gateway
      access requires a unique port.
      Ensure that the port range configured above has enough capacity to accommodate all the service
      instances that you need. The start port and the end port are both inclusive.
    </p>
    ![Diagram showing Service Gateway port ranges: Traffic flows to the apps from the Load Balancer
    using ports in the TAS LB port range through the TCP Router using ports in the TAS TCP port range.
    Traffic flows to the MySQL service instances from the Load Balancer using ports in the Service
    Gateway LB port range through the TCP Router using ports in the Service Gateway TCP port
    range.](images/service-gateway-ports.png)
1. Record this port range.


## <a id='create-dns-record'></a> Create a DNS Record That Maps to the Load Balancer

To create a DNS record and prepare to map it:

1. Following the documentation for your IaaS, create a new DNS record of type A that maps to the
external IP address of the load balancer created in
[Configure the Load Balancer in the IaaS to Redirect Traffic to the TCP Router](#configure-lb) above.
1. Record the domain used for this DNS record.


## <a id='configure-service-gateway-plan'></a> Enable Service-Gateway Access

When service-gateway access is enabled, all developers have the ability to create a service instance
that is available to apps outside the foundation.

For <%= vars.product_short %>, service-gateway access is enabled globally.
Access is not tied to certain service plans as in Tanzu RabbitMQ.


To configure service-gateway access for the foundation:

1. Go to the **Settings** pane in the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.

1. Under **Enable off-platform access of MySQL service instances**, click **Enabled**.

    ![Example of the Settings pane. Enabled is selected to reveal the External TCP Domain field where
    the text tcp.turtlegreen.cf-app.com is entered and the External TCP Port Range field where the
    text 1024-1123 is entered.](/images/global-settings-off-platform-access.png)

    This enables the feature and makes the domain and port range fields visible.

2. Configure the fields as follows:

    <table>
       <col width="20%">
        <tr>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Instructions</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>External TCP Domain</strong>
            </td>
            <td>
               Set this to the DNS entry for the external load balancer
               that you recorded in <a href="#create-dns-record">Create a DNS Record That Maps to the Load Balancer</a> above.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                <strong>External TCP Port Range</strong>
            </td>
            <td>
               Set this to the range of ports you configured for the external load balancer for MySQL
               service instances in <a href="#configure-lb">Configure the Load Balancer in the IaaS
               to Redirect Traffic to the TCP Router</a> above.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p class="note warning">
       <strong>Warning:</strong>
       If you already have service instances using service-gateway, any modifications to this range
       must include ports that are already assigned to these service instances.
       If the port range does not contain the ports already assigned to service instances, the
       upgrades for the service instances fail.
       For example, if service-gateway access has the port range <code>1000-1005</code>,
       and there are service instances that correspond to ports <code>1000</code>, <code>1001</code>,
       and <code>1002</code>, then the new port range must have ports <code>1000</code>,
       <code>1001</code>, and <code>1002</code>.
    </p>


    <p class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> If service-gateway access is disabled and then re-enabled, app
      developers must create new service keys to obtain a new set of credentials for service-gateway
      access.
    </p>

1. Go back to **<%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard &gt; Review Pending Changes**.

1. Click **Apply Changes** to apply the changes to the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.


## <a id='disable-service-gateway-access'></a> Disable Service-Gateway Access

<p class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> If service-gateway access is disabled and then re-enabled, app developers
  must create new service keys to obtain a new set of credentials for service-gateway access.
</p>

To disable service-gateway access:

1. Go to the **Settings** pane in the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.

1. Under **Enable off-platform access of MySQL service instances**, click **Disabled**.

1. Go back to **<%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard &gt; Review Pending Changes**.
