<h2> <a id='on-demand'></a>Default Network and Service Network </h2>

On-demand <%= vars.product_short %> services use BOSH to dynamically deploy VMs and create single-tenant service instances in a dedicated network. On-demand services use the dynamically-provisioned service network to host single-tenant worker VMs. These worker VMs run as service instances within development spaces.

This on-demand architecture has the following advantages:

*   Developers can provision IaaS resources for their services instances when the instances are created. This removes the need for operators to pre-provision a fixed amount of IaaS resources when they deploy the service broker.
*   Service instances run on a dedicated VM and do not share VMs with unrelated processes. This removes the "noisy neighbor" problem, where an app monopolizes resources on a shared cluster.
*   Single-tenant services can support regulatory compliances where sensitive data must be separated across different machines.

An on-demand service separates operations between the default network and the service network. Shared service components, such as executive controllers and databases, Cloud Controller, UAA, and other on-demand components, run on the default network. Worker pools deployed to specific spaces run on the service network.

The diagram below shows worker VMs in an on-demand service instance running on a separate services network, while other components run on the default network.

<h2> <a id='mysql-ports'></a> Required Networking Rules for <%= vars.product_short %> </h2>

Regardless of the specific network layout, the operator must set network rules.

To ensure that connections are open, see the table below:
